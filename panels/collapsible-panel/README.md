#### Where to use

Whenever a content needs to be encapsulated into a panel shape

#### Component best practices

For a visual explanation take a look at:

- [Designs](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/EMKHNWODTZA#/screens/299345214)
- [Wiki](https://wiki.commercetools.com/display/DD/Collapsible+Panel+-+Documentation)

**Header**

The header of this component should follow our design and UX conventions so it looks the same way all across the application. It accepts a `node` so two scenarios may occur:

1.  If the `CollapsiblePanel` is condensed

If the component is configured as `condensed`, all the content defined in the `header` will be wrapped in a `<Text.Detail />`. Take into account that in this scenario
no combinations of components are allowed.

```js
import CollapsiblePanel from '@commercetools-local/ui-kit/panels/collapsible-panel';

<CollapsiblePanel
  condensed={true}
  header={'My title'}
>
    </div>
</CollapsiblePanel>
```

2.  If the `CollapsiblePanel` is not condensed

In this case you will need to explicitly declare the header so it follows the designs.

```js
import CollapsiblePanel from '@commercetools-local/ui-kit/panels/collapsible-panel';

<CollapsiblePanel
  header={
    <CollapsiblePanel.Header>
      <FormattedMessage {...messages.title} />
    </CollapsiblePanel.Header>
  }
>
  <div />
</CollapsiblePanel>;
```

3.  Passing a combination of components (e.g. Label + Input)

Render inputs inside the `header` is allowed, but there are certain things that need to be taken into account:

- You can only render a maximum amount of 3 components inside the `header`.
- In case you need to display the combination of Label + Input. The input label should be bold and the input only a `<TextInput />`
- All has to be vertically aligned in the `header` container.

**Theme**

The themes were added to the component in order to put collapsible panels inside others. In case the background of the parent is `dark`,then the child needs to be `light` for consistency and better visibility in the UI.

**Condensed**

There are a few restrictions while using `condensed: true`

1.  You should not render anything besides the title. Nor button or inputs or anything that is not the title itself.
2.  The title should be only (if possible) a string or a combination of text components since all it's wrapped within a `<Text.Detail />`

**SecondaryHeader**

The `secondaryHeader` prop was added in case the UI needs to render some secondary information besides the title. It accepts a `node` but with few restrictions:

1.  Bold text is allowed while the text component is `<Text.Detail />`
2.  The text size should not exceed the font size of `<Text.Detail />`

**headerControls**

The `headerControls` allows you to render a component which can only contain buttons or links. Besides that, just one limitation:

1.  You can only render a maximu amount of 3 button inside the `headerControls`
